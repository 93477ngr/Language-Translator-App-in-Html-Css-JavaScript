Language Translator App in JavaScript [Source Codes]
To build this Language Translator App in JavaScript. First, you need to create four Files: HTML, CSS & JavaScript Files. After creating these files just paste the given codes into your file. You can also download the source code files of this translator app from the below download button and I also recommend you to download the source codes files.

First, create an HTML file with the name index.html and paste the given codes into your HTML file. Remember, you’ve to create a file with .html extension.
I hope you have seen a demo or video tutorial of this language translator app and know how I created it using HTML CSS & JavaScript. As you’ve seen, I used a free API to convert user-entered text into different languages.

This API is used only to convert text into other languages. Other things such as copying translated text and converting text to speech are done with JavaScript.

If you’re too beginner and don’t know about JavaScript array, fetch, and speech synthesis API, then the codes of this language translator might be hard to understand for you. So, before building this project, I suggest you learn these things or watch the above video 2 to 3 times to understand it because, in the video, I’ve explained these things in written comments.
